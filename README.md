# PCB 3D View

This is a 3D view of the designed PCB board.  
It contains various components such as:
- Terminal blocks for external connections (green connectors)
- IC (integrated circuit) mounted in DIP package
- Voltage regulator or transistor in TO-220 package with a heatsink
- A resistor
- A push button (yellow colored)
- Other essential electronic components required for circuit operation.

> **Note:**  
> There is a warning:  
> "**Board outline is missing or malformed. Run DRC for a full analysis.**"  
> Make sure to correct the board outline in your PCB design tool.

## Observations:
- Proper placement of components is visible.
- Sufficient spacing for terminal connections.
- The IC and voltage regulator are well-positioned.
- Board outline needs to be corrected for final production.

## Suggestions:
- Fix the board outline error.
- Verify clearances and perform a Design Rule Check (DRC).
- Add labels for terminals (optional but helpful).
